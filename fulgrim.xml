    <description>A Horus Heresy novel

As the Great Crusade draws to a close, primarch Fulgrim and the Emperor's Children continue their pursuit of perfection. But pride comes before a fall, and this most proud of Legions is about to fall a very, very long way...

READ IT BECAUSE
Graham McNeill paints a masterly portrait of a Legion brough low by their own hubris. And we see the epic Dropsite Massacre of Isstvan V, and the death of a primarch. Doesn't get much bigger than that.</description>
